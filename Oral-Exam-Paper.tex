\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We are going to summarize Allison's paper, while giving more support
  to some of her claims with the advantages of oral exams.
\end{itemize}

How do you know your students understand what's being taught? When they
score high on your exams, does that mean they really understand?
Following this train of thought, Theobold (2021) ((Theobold 2021))
convincingly argued that, in line with the 2016 GAISE standards that
recommend a focus on conceptual understanding and assessment of that
understanding (Carver et al. 2016), oral exams allow for us as
statistics and data science educators to more deeply assess what our
students actually know.

The benefits of oral exams go beyond assessment. As argued by Theobold
(2021) and others, they also develop communication skills {[}(Joughin
2010){]}, are a more authentic way to assess (\textbf{Wiggins1990?})
(Beccaria 2013), are powerful tools in gauging a student's understanding
and conceptions through conversation ((Iannone and Simpson
2012),(Asklund and Bendix 2003), (Huxham, Campbell, and Westwood 2012)),
and (especially pertinent in the age of AI Chatbots) they greatly
discourage plagiarism ((Newell 2023), (Ramella 2019)). Students also
prepare more? (*This is interesting\ldots{} I wonder if that kind of
thing has been looked at. How do students differ in their preparation
for an oral exam vs a pen/paper style.)

Oral exams, of course, are not without their challenges. For example,
whereas a written assessment assumes a student's proficiency with the
\emph{written} language, oral exams assume a student's proficiency with
the \emph{spoken} langue. ESL students in particular may experience
difficulties unrelated to the content being tested, potentially turning
a statistics test into an English test. Another issue is bias: Written
exams can have confusing questions, but at least they can be graded
blind. Oral exams, on the other hand, require a face to face
interaction, and with that brings the possibility of evaluating a
student based on how they've done previously, \ldots.. and even feeling
hungry (as one TA mentions later) need to be carefully evaluated.
Finally, oral exams may not only negatively impact our students with
test anxiety (which a written exam also might), but the new format may
make that anxiety worse, along with pulling in our students with social
or speaking anxiety.

These challenges have been successfully mitigated in the literature, but
only for smaller classes. How do we do an assessment with promising
returns on understanding our students' understanding in a class of 100?
200? Or, in the case of this study, 884? This is an open problem in the
oral exam literature (Asklund and Bendix 2003),(Ohmann 2019). As class
sizes increase, it becomes necessary to enlist help in the form of other
instructors, potentially increasing bias in evaluation. Oral exams that,
normally, range from 15-45 minutes long \textbf{citations} may need to
be shortened, which will impact reliability negatively (Memon, Joughin,
and Memon 2010). Where professors could administer these exams in
person, they may instead need to administer them on a computer, using
video calling software like zoom, which can enlist a host of new issues
to deal with.

With scale comes a new group to study beyond the students: the
administrators of the exam. This study follows a group of graduate
teaching assistants who are the instructor of record for one-credit
programming courses. While seasoned instructors may feel comfortable
engaging in a conversation with students and gauging understanding,
novice instructors administering oral exams is a very different
proposition. This study attempts to understand problems of practice that
arise for novice instructors when attempting to scale oral exam
administration to a large number of students.

In addition, we outline the process used to develop and administer oral
exams at scale with a discussion of what worked well and what could be
improved upon.

\hypertarget{methods}{%
\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}}

This study follows six graduate teaching assistants that were
instructors of record for one-credit programming courses. These courses
cover either R programming or SAS programming. Each instructor had three
or four sections of one of these courses.

\hypertarget{sas-course-information}{%
\subsubsection{SAS Course Information}\label{sas-course-information}}

This course introduces students to programming in SAS through SAS Studio
in the SAS OnDemand for Academics browser-based platform. The course
covers topics like reading in raw data with \texttt{PROC\ IMPORT}, basic
row and column manipulations of SAS datasets through the
\texttt{DATA\ step}, summarizing data numerically with
\texttt{PROC\ FREQ}, \texttt{PROC\ UNIVARIATE}, and
\texttt{PROC\ MEANS}, summarizing data graphically with
\texttt{PROC\ SGPLOT} and \texttt{PROC\ SGPANEL}, analysis of means
using \texttt{PROC\ TTEST} and \texttt{PROC\ GLM}, and fitting linear
models (one-way ANOVA and Multiple Linear Regression) through
\texttt{PROC\ GLM}.

The course has a prerequisite of a business statistics course or a
corequisite of a second course in statistics. These restrictions allow
the course to cover the creation and interpretation of statistical
models without the need to introduce the statistical concepts
surrounding these topics.

The course serves two major audiences (detailed shortly):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Statistics majors and minors
\item
  Business majors
\end{itemize}

The statistics majors generally have taken an introductory statistics
course, an introductory programming course in python, and are taking the
second course in statistics concurrently with the course (or have
already taken it). The statistics minors are similar but do not
generally have the introductory programming course. The business majors
usually enroll in the course having taken a business statistics course
at some point earlier in their academic careers.

For both audiences, the broad purpose of the course from the program
level is to provide the students with a thorough introduction to using
SAS in order to facilitate the use of SAS in their upper level
statistics or business courses. The course learning outcomes are listed
on the syllabus as follows:

\begin{quote}
This course provides an introduction to programming using the SAS
statistical software. At the end of this course students will be able to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  write and explain the purpose of basic SAS steps and statements
\item
  utilize SAS help files to customize SAS programs
\item
  correctly read well-structured data into SAS
\item
  perform common data manipulations using SAS
\item
  produce and interpret standard numeric and graphical summaries of data
  using SAS
\item
  produce, interpret, and assess the validity of assumptions of
\item
  statistical hypothesis tests and confidence intervals using SAS
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{r-course-information}{%
\subsubsection{R Course Information}\label{r-course-information}}

This course introduces students to programming in the R software through
the RStudio Interactive Development Environment. The course covers
topics like using and manipulating common R objects (such as lists, data
frames, and (atomic) vectors), reading in raw data using the
\texttt{readr}, \texttt{haven}, and \texttt{readxl} packages, creating
output documents with R Markdown, common row and column manipulations
with the \texttt{dplyr} and \texttt{tidyr} packages, summarizing data
numerically, summarizing data graphically with the \texttt{ggplot2}
package, using vectorized functions and for loops, and writing custom
functions.

This course does not have a prequisite or corequisite. This causes the
course to cover more programming-centric topics and less statistical
topics when compared to the SAS programming course.

The course serves the same two major audiences as the SAS programming
course (statistics majors/minors and business majors). Again, the
statistics majors have generally had an introductory programming course
prior to taking this R programming course but the other students usually
do not have a programming background.

The broad purpose of the course from the program level is to provide the
students with a thorough introduction to using R in order to facilitate
the use of R in their upper level statistics or business courses. The
course learning outcomes are listed on the syllabus as follows:

\begin{quote}
This course provides an introduction to programming using the
statistical software R. At the end of this course students will be able
to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  read, write, and explain the steps and purpose of R programs
\item
  efficiently read in and manipulate data in R
\item
  utilize R help and other resources to customize programs
\item
  produce and interpret static and interactive graphics using R
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{course-structure}{%
\subsubsection{Course Structure}\label{course-structure}}

These programming courses have a flipped structure where students
receive the course content prior to their class meeting time in order to
spend most of the class time on activities involving active
participation. With many of the students in the courses having limited
to no programming exposure, having a flipped course allows the students
to gain basic knowledge of the material through videos. They can then
come to class and actually \textbf{do} programming while having an
expert (the course instructor) in the room and support from their peers.
This ideally leads to students having a direct line of help when they
get stuck rather than running into an error, getting frustrated, and
stopping their learning. They also can see the struggles of others to
know that they aren't out of place if they are having difficulty. Not
only that but students can go back to watch and rewatch topics they find
difficult.

Although not the purpose of using a flipped structure, another benefit
of this design is that graduate students can reasonably be expected to
support students within the classroom as the instructor of the course.
These graduate students may not have the pedagogical knowledge or
experience to effectively teach programming material themselves, but
many have the problem solving skills to help students work through
issues that come up. As these two courses serve approximately 800
students each semester, this is a definite benefit from the
administrative side. Graduate students can be assigned to reasonably
small sections of students (40 students maximum) and provide more
one-on-one attention to the learners.

These classes meet once a week for 50 minutes at a time. Most weeks
students are expected to watch one to two videos that cover the learning
objectives for the week. These videos are approximately 10-20 minutes
each and are created by the course coordinator. The videos usually have
two or three quizzes throughout, each with three to four questions, to
help students assess their understanding as they watch. Students are
expected to complete these videos prior to their weekly session.

During most class periods, the instructor briefly recaps the material
for the week (less than five minutes), takes questions, and introduces
the in-class activity for the week. The students are then given the bulk
of the class time to work in small groups or individually on the
activity. The instructor takes an active role during this period,
checking in on students and answering questions that come up. The last
five minutes of the class are used to recap important parts of the
activity.

Weeks that follow this structure then have a quiz administered on the
course learning management software that must be completed a few days
after the class. The questions in these quizzes vary across the common
auto-graded types of questions such as multiple choice, fill in the
blank, etc. and some are very similar to the questions asked during the
videos.

There were four weeks that did not follow this structure. Two of those
weeks replaced the usual in-class period with a short quiz (10 minutes)
followed by time to work on a homework assignment. These assignments
involved creating their own original program to answer questions of
interest along with finding a dataset of their own and applying class
concepts. The two other weeks were dedicated to administering their oral
exams. These weeks involved no new content and no class was held.

This is more of a descriptive thematic analysis. We want to find themes,
or patterns, in what is being said, but we're not trying to interpret,
just describe what the TAs are focusing on. Three passes. Multiple
passes were made over the surveys and discussion comments. The first few
passes were to begin clustering comments and discussion points by common
themes. The next few passes were to iteratively update the themes that
had been created in order to refine the themes. Time split up.
Um\ldots.where we compiled evidence and time points and where they came
from underneath them, then finding evidence for each one or splitting
them.

\hypertarget{results}{%
\subsection{Results}\label{results}}

\hypertarget{the-tas-focused-on-time}{%
\subsubsection{The TAs focused on time}\label{the-tas-focused-on-time}}

\textbf{The Quantity of time}

On a pre-exam survey, half of the TAs expressed concerns about the
``time'' or ``timeframe'' of administering so many oral exams to so many
students over a week. After the first round, some of the TAs gave
estimates of 12 to 18 hours to complete their oral exams.

Others used verbal descriptions, such as it ``took way too long'' and
``overall, very time consuming'' to express the magnitude of the time
commitment. Words such as ``grueling'', that this was something they had
to ``endure'', and that it was ``extremely time inefficient'' were used
to express their feelings towards the amount of time needed. One TA,
after administering their first oral exam, said (somewhat jokingly), ``I
was losing my sanity being on zoom for so long''.

One reason for this focus on the time commitment was given by one TA,
who commented that they were promised less work as first years, but that
this was not the case in this class.''If the oral exam format goes
unchanged'', they said, ``I am unsure if I am fit to be an instructor
next semester''.

\textbf{What they were doing during that time}

Beyond the actual time it took to administer the exams was talk centered
around what they could and couldn't do during that time. In the first
whole group discussion after the first oral exam, several people joked
about not even being able to use the bathroom since you have to be
``100\% focused''. In a later discussion, they focused on incorporating
time to get a snack, stand up, and walk around.

The way they were spending their time administering exams was contrasted
with HW grading. In one discussion, one TA commented that, for them, the
exams took longer, and, unlike HW, with the exams you had to ``block out
time''. Another TA disagreed, saying the time commitment felt similar,
but later, acknowledging that it could take similar time, a final TA
commented that grading HW was more ``flexible''.

\textbf{When things went wrong with timing}

Especially after the first few exams, TAs focused on issues with student
timing. One talked about the fragility of the online set up, where if
even one student comes late, it can ``ruin the timing for all of the
students''. This inspired another strong question about ``how to make
everyone register and show up on time''. Having to reschedule with
students who missed, either to Saturday or to next week,and how to avoid
it, dominated the final group discussion after the administration of the
last oral exam. Other issues of timing were caused by technical
difficulties with Zoom and the ensuing delays, as well as the burden of
time bleeding into other classes and exams the TAs had outside of their
positions.

When the TAs were asked about advice they would give to future TAs
participating in the same experience as themselves, their advice
overwhelmingly centered around optimal time management due to previously
mentioned experiences with students not showing up on time or having to
reschedule. For example, TAs offered comments such as ``If possible,
avoid scheduling any time on Friday'' so as to plan for students who
miss their time slots, ``try to make everyone schedule and show up on
time'', and ``build in more than a 5 minute break every 30 minutes'' or
else, due to students not arriving to the meeting on time, ``you'll need
to use {[}it{]}''.

\hypertarget{the-tas-focused-on-equity}{%
\subsubsection{The TAs focused on
Equity}\label{the-tas-focused-on-equity}}

Even before administering exams, TAs worried about their role not just
as administrators but as graders. One worried that the grading might be
``too subjective''. Another worried about their ``poor memory'' and bias
that could come from familiarity. One TA even cautioned against ``food
bias'' where you many grade someone more harshly while hungry. Some of
these issues were borne out during the first discussion when two TAs
used different follow-up questions other than on the rubric when asking
about an R object, and the teacher and one TA used different follow up
questions to discuss R libraries. Several TAs after the first few oral
exams expressed interest in changing the grading scale, so as to be fair
to students who may have needed prompting, but still got the right
answer.

The TAs were also worried that the oral exam would be confounded with
speaking ability. In one exchange between the teacher and one TA, the TA
shared one ESL student wanted to do it in person since, through zoom,
``it {[}was{]} hard for them to understand the questions clearly''.
Other TAs during the first survey expressed similar views, with one on
the final survey indicating that ESL students should be given more time,
since ``this is not an english test''.

There were other minor focuses that didn't always consistently appear or
only appeared because a they were explicitly asked in a survey: their
views on oral vs written exams, and positive thoughts (if any) about the
process.

\hypertarget{their-views-on-oral-vs-written-exams}{%
\subsubsection{Their views on Oral vs Written
Exams}\label{their-views-on-oral-vs-written-exams}}

After the first round of exams, a few TAs expressed doubt over the
utility of the oral exam format. ``Not sure what this accomplishes over
HW/{[}online{]} quiz'' on said. ``A paper quiz'', another said, ``could
serve the same goal''. After seeing these responses, a specific question
about their views on oral vs written exams was asked, with mixed
responses. Half agreed there was something different or better, but
those differences boiled down to ``open book'' vs ``closed book'' exams,
examining ``on the fly knowledge''. Luckily one TA did mention the
benefit of being able to ``follow up''. The other half thought that a
well crafted, open ended quiz could essentially serve the same purpose.

\hypertarget{positives-or-oral-exam-experience}{%
\subsubsection{Positives or Oral exam
experience}\label{positives-or-oral-exam-experience}}

When asked directly about positives, only half of the TAs had something
to say, with all the comments being centered around having increased
student interactions where, in such a large class, they usually didn't.
One TA commented that, unprovoked, a few students talked about liking
the format.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

\textbf{Matthew and Justin} will work on this part after literature
review and results are complete.

Probably will mention this not being a good idea, probably losing what
makes an Oral exam really good as we try to adapt to scale

Probably going to talk about how this is our attempt in a realistic
setting\ldots.we could try to create an ideal one, and see, or we could
couch it in based on the literature, ideally it would look like this.
See that it's really not possible, this was our attempt realistically.

One big issue is most oral exams are in a problem based format, some
questions, time\ldots.with only 5 minutes, you can't do that or do that
well. You lose that part of really testing a student's thinking and
assessing how well they can explain \emph{and} do.

Issues with reliability.

\textbf{Future research questions} include

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AI enhanced oral assessment?
\item
  Student perceptions positive in literature, but how does doing it for
  5 minutes in zoom change things? Having to compare and contrast
  experiences
\item
  \textbf{Others?}
\end{itemize}

As oral exams scale, help is required, and in a university setting is
going to come from less experienced instructors. We want to see what we

in a large scale oral exam process, their thoughts and feelings that had
