## Background


- <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Six GSIs teaching 3-4 sections of introductory programming</span>
- <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Approximately 700 total students</span>
- <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Two oral exams given</span>

## Setup & Planning

- <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Full week dedicated to each oral exam</span>
- <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Five minute zoom meetings</span>
- <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Moodle scheduler for sign up</span>
- <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Rubric on Moodle for live grading</span>
- <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Structured interview protocol style questions</span>
- <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Data collected on GSI thoughts & experience</span>

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '500px'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Oral_Exam_Flow_Chart.drawio.png")
```

## Results

1. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>GSI Challenges</span>

    - Scheduling of students & time management (self-care)
    - Balancing other responsibilities
    - Extra time for make-up exams
    - Initial Zoom & Moodle training

2. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Oral Exam Grading</span>

    - Novice instructors had concerns about their ability to be unbiased and fair to students
    - Oral exam rubric required a finer scale
    
3. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>GSI Experience</span>

    - Some enjoyed getting to know students and interacting in a new setting
    - Others disliked the time & schedule required and talking with struggling students
    - Anecdotally, students had a lot of anxiety for the first exam but felt positively toward the second exam

4. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Future Student Preparation</span>

    - Need to incorporate more opportunites for students to practice verbalizing concepts
    - Ensuring students focus on the vocabulary of the language (i.e. data frame vs vector)

## Recommendations

1. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Multiple Forms of GSI Feedback is Essential</span>

2. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Optimize Scheduling for GSIs</span>
3. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Preach the why for oral exams</span>
4. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Prepare through practice </span>

    - Roleplay prior to implementation
    - Provide follow-up questions
    - Bring GSIs into the creation process

5. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Use Technology</span>

    - Use video conferencing software (ease of scheduling, recording of discussion)
    - Practice on the technology you'll use!

6. <span style = 'font-family: monospace; font-size: 55px;'>Prepare your students</span>

    - Opportunities to practice discussing the material
    
## Future

Understand the student experience! Do oral exams still give the same benefits if they are only 5 minutes? Can generative AI provide similar experiences (at least for practice)?
