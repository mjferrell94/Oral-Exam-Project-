# Oral Exam Paper

## Abstract

Won't write anything here until the paper is complete

## Introduction

Will probably be second to last thing

## Literature Review

**Matthew** will work on this part. It will be structured as

-   Advantages of Oral Assessment vs Written (multiple choice, short answer, etc.)
-   Challenges with Oral Assessment
-   How Scale affects these all
-   Gap we are filling is the largest scale oral exam attempt, understanding from TA perspective

## Methods

**Justin** will work on the exam part.

-   What were the classes?
-   How was the Exam Set up?
    -   Each exam was 5 minutes
    -   **How were they graded?**
    -   **What kinds of questions were asked?**
    -   They were conducted on Zoom over the course of a week
    -   6 TA's plus 1 instructor administered them
    -   **What was the rubric?**
-   How was the exam monitored?
    -   Weekly meetings
    -   Surveys

**Matthew** will work on the methodology of analyzing the data.

-   Common themes, content/ thematic analysis

## Results

**Matthew** will work on this part.

-   The 5 themes

## Discussion

**Matthew and Justin** will work on this part after literature review and results are complete.

Probably will mention this not being a good idea, probably losing what makes an Oral exam really good as we try to adapt to scale

**Future research questions** include

-   AI enhanced oral assessment?
-   Student perceptions positive in literature, but how does doing it for 5 minutes in zoom change things? Having to compare and contrast experiences
-   **Others?**

## Conclusion

**Matthew and Justin** will work on this part after literature review and results are complete.
