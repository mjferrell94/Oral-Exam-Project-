# Oral Exam Paper

## Abstract

Won't write anything here until the paper is complete

## 1. Introduction

-   We are going to summarize Allison's paper, while giving more support to some of her claims with the advantages of oral exams.

How do you know your students understand what's being taught? When they score high on your exams, does that mean they really understand? Following this train of thought, Theobold (2021) ([@Theobold2021]) convincingly argued that, in line with the 2016 GAISE standards that recommend a focus on conceptual understanding and assessment of that understanding [@carver2016guidelines], oral exams allow for us as statistics and data science educators to more deeply assess what our students actually know.

The benefits of oral exams go beyond assessment. As argued by Theobold (2021) and others, they also develop communication skills \[[@Joughin2010]\], are a more authentic way to assess [@Wiggins1990] [@Beccaria2013], are powerful tools in gauging a student's understanding and conceptions through conversation ([@Iannone2012],[@Asklund2003], [@Huxham2012]), and (especially pertinent in the age of AI Chatbots) they greatly discourage plagiarism ([@Newell2023], [@Ramella2019]). Students also prepare more?

Oral exams, of course, are not without their challenges.For example,whereas a written assessment assumes a student's proficiency with the *written* language, oral exams assume a student's proficiency with the *spoken* langue. ESL students in particular may experience difficulties unrelated to the content being tested, potentially turning a statistics test into an English test. Another issue is bias: Written exams can have confusing questions, but at least they can be graded blind. Oral exams, on the other hand, require a face to face interaction, and with that brings the possibility of such as evaluating a student based on how they've done previously, ..... and even feeling hungry (as one TA mentions later) need to be carefully evaluated. Finally, oral exams may not only negatively impact our students with test anxiety (which a written exam also might), but the new format may make that anxiety worse, along with pulling in our students with social or speaking anxiety.

These challenges have been successfully mitigated in the literature, but only for smaller classes. How do we do an assessment with promising returns on understanding our students' understanding in a class of 100? 200? Or, in the case of this study, 884? This is an open problem in the oral exam literature [@Asklund2003],[@Ohmann2019]. As class sizes increase, it becomes necessary to enlist help in the form of other instructors, potentially increasing bias in evaluation. Oral exams that, normally, range from 15-45 minutes long **citations** may need to be shortened, which will impact reliability negatively [@Memon2010]. Where professors could administer these exams in person, they may instead need to administer them on a computer, using video calling software like zoom.


With scale comes a new group to study beyond the students: the administrators of the exam.

Really we can acknowledge the perfect situation. Show what our situation was like. How much of an impact did that make? We don't know for sure... we only know it in terms of

First, we are attempting it. Second, we're focusing on a TA perspective. As oral exams scale, help is required, and in a university setting is going to come from less experienced instructors. We want to see what we learned from this, and also, for less expereinced instuctors engaging in a large scale oral exam process, their thoughts and feelings that had compared to what we might have wanted. ....I still need more clarification here haha (**Justin might be good here**).

-   What about very large ones?

-   Talk about how this is an open issue for stats educators and of course the wider oral exam literature as a whole, and what issues scale might introduce

-   Our contribution is sharing how we attempted in a statistical programming setting implementing oral exams at large scale

-   **Why are we Focusing on the TA perspective since they were the ones mainly administering it?**


## Methods

**Justin** will work on the exam part.

-   What were the classes?
-   How was the Exam Set up?
    -   Each exam was 5 minutes
    -   **How were they graded?**
    -   **What kinds of questions were asked?**
    -   They were conducted on Zoom over the course of a week
    -   6 TA's plus 1 instructor administered them
    -   **What was the rubric?**
-   How was the exam monitored?
    -   Weekly meetings
    -   Surveys

**Matthew** will work on the methodology of analyzing the data.

This is more of a descriptive thematic analysis. We want to find themes, or patterns, in what is being said, but we're not trying to interpret, just describe what the TAs are focusing on. Three passes. Multiple passes were made over the surveys and discussion comments. The first few passes were to begin clustering comments and discussion points by common themes. The next few passes were to iteratively update the themes that had been created in order to refine the themes. Time split up. Um....where we compiled evidence and time points and where they came from underneath them, then finding evidence for each one or splitting them. 

## Results

### The TAs focused on time

**The Quantity of time**

On a pre-exam survey, half of the TAs expressed concerns about the "time" or "timeframe" of administering so many oral exams to so many students over a week. After the first round, some of the TAs gave estimates of 12 to 18 hours to complete their oral exams.

Others used verbal descriptions, such as it "took way too long" and "overall, very time consuming" to express the magnitude of the time commitment. Words such as "grueling", that this was something they had to "endure", and that it was "extremely time inefficient" were used to express their feelings towards the amount of time needed. One TA, after administering their first oral exam, said (somewhat jokingly), "I was losing my sanity being on zoom for so long".

One reason for this focus on the time commitment was given by one TA, who commented that they were promised less work as first years, but that this was not the case in this class."If the oral exam format goes unchanged", they said, "I am unsure if I am fit to be an instructor next semester".

**What they were doing during that time**

Beyond the actual time it took to administer the exams was talk centered around what they could and couldn't do during that time. In the first whole group discussion after the first oral exam, several people joked about not even being able to use the bathroom since you have to be "100% focused". In a later discussion, they focused on incorporating time to get a snack, stand up, and walk around.

The way they were spending their time administering exams was contrasted with HW grading. In one discussion, one TA commented that, for them, the exams took longer, and, unlike HW, with the exams you had to "block out time". Another TA disagreed, saying the time commitment felt similar, but later, acknowledging that it could take similar time, a final TA commented that grading HW was more "flexible".

**When things went wrong with timing**

Especially after the first few exams, TAs focused on issues with student timing. One talked about the fragility of the online set up, where if even one student comes late, it can "ruin the timing for all of the students". This inspired another strong question about "how to make everyone register and show up on time". Having to reschedule with students who missed, either to Saturday or to next week,and how to avoid it, dominated the final group discussion after the administration of the last oral exam. Other issues of timing were caused by technical difficulties with Zoom and the ensuing delays, as well as the burden of time bleeding into other classes and exams the TAs had outside of their positions.

When the TAs were asked about advice they would give to future TAs participating in the same experience as themselves, their advice overwhelmingly centered around optimal time management due to previously mentioned experiences with students not showing up on time or having to reschedule. For example, TAs offered comments such as "If possible, avoid scheduling any time on Friday" so as to plan for students who miss their time slots, "try to make everyone schedule and show up on time", and "build in more than a 5 minute break every 30 minutes" or else, due to students not arriving to the meeting on time, "you'll need to use \[it\]".

### The TAs focused on Equity

Even before administering exams, TAs worried about their role not just as administrators but as graders. One worried that the grading might be "too subjective". Another worried about their "poor memory" and bias that could come from familiarity. One TA even cautioned against "food bias" where you many grade someone more harshly while hungry. Some of these issues were borne out during the first discussion when two TAs used different follow-up questions other than on the rubric when asking about an R object, and the teacher and one TA used different follow up questions to discuss R libraries. Several TAs after the first few oral exams expressed interest in changing the grading scale, so as to be fair to students who may have needed prompting, but still got the right answer.

The TAs were also worried that the oral exam would be confounded with speaking ability. In one exchange between the teacher and one TA, the TA shared one ESL student wanted to do it in person since, through zoom, "it \[was\] hard for them to understand the questions clearly". Other TAs during the first survey expressed similar views, with one on the final survey indicating that ESL students should be given more time, since "this is not an english test".

There were other minor focuses that didn't always consistently appear or only appeared because a they were explicitly asked in a survey: their views on oral vs written exams, and positive thoughts (if any) about the process.

### Their views on Oral vs Written Exams

After the first round of exams, a few TAs expressed doubt over the utility of the oral exam format. "Not sure what this accomplishes over HW/\[online\] quiz" on said. "A paper quiz", another said, "could serve the same goal". After seeing these responses, a specific question about their views on oral vs written exams was asked, with mixed responses. Half agreed there was something different or better, but those differences boiled down to "open book" vs "closed book" exams, examining "on the fly knowledge". Luckily one TA did mention the benefit of being able to "follow up". The other half thought that a well crafted, open ended quiz could essentially serve the same purpose.

### Positives or Oral exam experience

When asked directly about positives, only half of the TAs had something to say, with all the comments being centered around having increased student interactions where, in such a large class, they usually didn't. One TA commented that, unprovoked, a few students talked about liking the format.

## Discussion

**Matthew and Justin** will work on this part after literature review and results are complete.

Probably will mention this not being a good idea, probably losing what makes an Oral exam really good as we try to adapt to scale

Probably going to talk about how this is our attempt in a realistic setting....we could try to create an ideal one, and see, or we could couch it in based on the literature, ideally it would look like this. See that it's really not possible, this was our attempt realistically.

One big issue is most oral exams are in a problem based format, some questions, time....with only 5 minutes, you can't do that or do that well. You lose that part of really testing a student's thinking and assessing how well they can explain *and* do.

Issues with reliability.

**Future research questions** include

-   AI enhanced oral assessment?
-   Student perceptions positive in literature, but how does doing it for 5 minutes in zoom change things? Having to compare and contrast experiences
-   **Others?**

## Conclusion

**Matthew and Justin** will work on this part after literature review and results are complete.
