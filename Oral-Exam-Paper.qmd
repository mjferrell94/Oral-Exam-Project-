# Oral Exam Paper

## Abstract

Won't write anything here until the paper is complete

## Introduction

Will probably be second to last thing

## Literature Review

**Matthew** will work on this part. It will be structured as

-   Advantages of Oral Assessment vs Written (multiple choice, short answer, etc.)
-   Challenges with Oral Assessment
-   How Scale affects these all
-   Gap we are filling is the largest scale oral exam attempt, understanding from TA perspective

## Methods

**Justin** will work on the exam part.

-   What were the classes?
-   How was the Exam Set up?
    -   Each exam was 5 minutes
    -   **How were they graded?**
    -   **What kinds of questions were asked?**
    -   They were conducted on Zoom over the course of a week
    -   6 TA's plus 1 instructor administered them
    -   **What was the rubric?**
-   How was the exam monitored?
    -   Weekly meetings
    -   Surveys

**Matthew** will work on the methodology of analyzing the data.

-   Common themes, content/ thematic analysis

## Results

**Matthew** will work on this part.

### A focus on time

*The Quantity of time*

Most of the novice instructor's thoughts were centered around the time commitment necessary to administer the oral exams to over a hundred students per TA in a one week period. Estimates were given of between 12 to 18 hours spent administering the exams and grading.

They also used words such as "grueling", that this was something they had to "endure", and that it was "extremely time inefficient" to describe the setup. One TA said (somewhat jokingly), "I was losing my sanity being on zoom for so long".

*The Quality of the situation*

Beyond the actual time it took to administer the exams was talk centered around what the time looked like. For example,you had to be 100% focused. You couldn't even get up to have normal bathroom breaks when you wanted, or to eat anything. Debated about whether it was better than HW, one person commented "you have to block out time for the exam", where as HW is a bit more flexible. 

One reason for this focus on the time commitment was given by one TA, who commented that they were promised less work as first years, but that this was not the case in this class.

*Optimizing time*


*When things go wrong with time*


### Equity


### Views on Oral vs Written Exams


### Positive Student interactions 



### Equity



## Discussion

**Matthew and Justin** will work on this part after literature review and results are complete.

Probably will mention this not being a good idea, probably losing what makes an Oral exam really good as we try to adapt to scale

**Future research questions** include

-   AI enhanced oral assessment?
-   Student perceptions positive in literature, but how does doing it for 5 minutes in zoom change things? Having to compare and contrast experiences
-   **Others?**

## Conclusion

**Matthew and Justin** will work on this part after literature review and results are complete.
