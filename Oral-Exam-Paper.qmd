# Oral Exam Paper

## Abstract

Won't write anything here until the paper is complete

## 1. Introduction

-   We are going to summarize Allison's paper, while giving more support to some of her claims with the advantages of oral exams.

In 2021, Allison Theobold ([@Theobold2021]) argued that oral exams allow for a deeper assessment of student understanding, in line with the 2016 Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) that recommend a focus on student conceptual understanding and assessment of student reasoning [@carver2016guidelines].

**They. She, Theobold?** also provided four additional benefits of oral exams: first, they develop communication skills, second, they are more authentic, third, they powerfully gauge a student's understanding and conceptions through conversation, and, fourth, they discourage plagiarism. These additional benefits have been seen in the wider oral exam literature, especially with gauging student understanding ([@Iannone2012],[@Asklund2003], [@Huxham2012]) and encouraging academic integrity ([@Newell2023], [@Ramella2019]). 

Of course, like any form of assessment, oral exams also comes with unique challenges. Reliability, bias, time

While mitigating the challenges and creating an optimal space for giving oral exams has been shown to be possible with relatively smaller classes, an open problem is how do things change when the class sizes get large. **Provide examples from literature of normal class sizes used, with respect to the number of instructors as well**

**Literature about growing class sizes for statistics and data science education specifically.....see what's out there, or just general statement. Plus online and distance education**

-   We are going to talk about the negatives

-   We are going to mention how mitigating these and adhering to the practices mention in Allison's paper, we know they can be done with smaller class sizes

-   What about very large ones?

-   Talk about how this is an open issue for stats educators and of course the wider oral exam literature as a whole, and what issues scale might introduce

-   Our contribution is sharing how we attempted in a statistical programming setting implementing oral exams at large scale

-   **Why are we Focusing on the TA perspective since they were the ones mainly administering it?**

[@Huxham2012] They list 5 advantages that also align with what I've seen in the literature...[@Joughin2010] has very similar if not the same ones....[@Theobold2021] does as well.

One advantage of oral examinations over written exams is the ability of the instructor to engage in a dialogue with the students "without question wording or guessing getting in the way" [@Ohmann2019]. [@Asklund2003] surmises that, unlike written exams, oral exams allow for questioning that can cover topics more widley and more deeply. (This has the chart showing the possibility of assessing across the spectrum of knowledge per topic). [@Theobold2021] [@Roecker2007] [@Iannone2012] “the students in our sample particularly focus the fourth of these issues, highlighting the ability of oral assessments to gauge understanding and the inability to get high marks in them simply from parroting answers.”

Another are that students better prepare for them. [@Ohmann2019]

Another is that oral exams are a more authentic means of assessment. [@Wiggins1990] [@Beccaria2013] [@Ramella2019] [@Roecker2007] Students felt like it was a more fair one...

Finally, oral exams help encourage academic integrity.[@Newell2023] [@Ramella2019]

Contrary to what we may initially believe, oral exams are not more stressful. [@Ohmann2019] [@Baghdadchi2022] (Engineering study with n=316, 6 classes, each with TA, positively, like the interaction, learning, not much undue stress though for some) [@Sabin2021] [@Roecker2007] Consistent positive and enlightening commments, students have felt like it's fairer and a more valid assessment of their understanding.

# Challenges with Oral Assessment

Several authors talked about bias and equity. Since it is face to face, there are stereotype and halo biases to look out for. Turns out that longer tests have higher reliability than shorter ones. Extra time administering and grading the exams. [@Memon2010] [@Gerlt2023] [@Joughin2010]

# How Scale affects these all

Unfortunately, scale has a double negative effect: it increases bias and decreases the potency of the positive aspects of oral exams. Several authors have acknowledged the challenge posed by increasing class sizes ([@Ohmann2019],[@Roecker2007]). When previous studies have examined the application of oral exams, they have usually used an instructor to student ratio between 1:30 and 1:40 and 15-30 minutes of exam time. What happens when the ratio is 1:120?

Many authors acknowledge that though these sound nice and negatives can be mitigated, scale is a huge problem. They talk about it in terms of time. [@Ohmann2019] [@Roecker2007] [@Iannone2012] [@Sabin2021] [@Asklund2023]

They talk about it in terms of reliability (now that you have multiple graders, how do you maintain fairness across them all? How do you insure no bias across them all?) This requires extra training and more time.

Most exams in the literature were from 15-30 minutes. Once class sizes start becoming really large, time is still an issue.

No physical space.

# Gap we are filling is the largest scale oral exam attempt, understanding from TA perspective

With scale comes a new group to study beyond the students: the administrators of the exam.

Really we can acknowledge the perfect situation. Show what our situation was like. How much of an impact did that make? We don't know for sure... we only know it in terms of

First, we are attempting it. Second, we're focusing on a TA perspective. As oral exams scale, help is required, and in a university setting is going to come from less experienced instructors. We want to see what we learned from this, and also, for less expereinced instuctors engaging in a large scale oral exam process, their thoughts and feelings that had compared to what we might have wanted. ....I still need more clarification here haha (**Justin might be good here**).

### The TAs focused on time

**The Quantity of time**

On a pre-exam survey, half of the TAs expressed concerns about the "time" or "timeframe" of administering so many oral exams to so many students over a week. After the first round, some of the TAs gave estimates of 12 to 18 hours to complete their oral exams.

Others used verbal descriptions, such as it "took way too long" and "overall, very time consuming" to express the magnitude of the time commitment. Words such as "grueling", that this was something they had to "endure", and that it was "extremely time inefficient" were used to express their feelings towards the amount of time needed. One TA, after administering their first oral exam, said (somewhat jokingly), "I was losing my sanity being on zoom for so long".

One reason for this focus on the time commitment was given by one TA, who commented that they were promised less work as first years, but that this was not the case in this class."If the oral exam format goes unchanged", they said, "I am unsure if I am fit to be an instructor next semester".

**What they were doing during that time**

Beyond the actual time it took to administer the exams was talk centered around what they could and couldn't do during that time. In the first whole group discussion after the first oral exam, several people joked about not even being able to use the bathroom since you have to be "100% focused". In a later discussion, they focused on incorporating time to get a snack, stand up, and walk around.

The way they were spending their time administering exams was contrasted with HW grading. In one discussion, one TA commented that, for them, the exams took longer, and, unlike HW, with the exams you had to "block out time". Another TA disagreed, saying the time commitment felt similar, but later, acknowledging that it could take similar time, a final TA commented that grading HW was more "flexible".

**When things went wrong with timing**

Especially after the first few exams, TAs focused on issues with student timing. One talked about the fragility of the online set up, where if even one student comes late, it can "ruin the timing for all of the students". This inspired another strong question about "how to make everyone register and show up on time". Having to reschedule with students who missed, either to Saturday or to next week,and how to avoid it, dominated the final group discussion after the administration of the last oral exam. Other issues of timing were caused by technical difficulties with Zoom and the ensuing delays, as well as the burden of time bleeding into other classes and exams the TAs had outside of their positions.

When the TAs were asked about advice they would give to future TAs participating in the same experience as themselves, their advice overwhelmingly centered around optimal time management due to previously mentioned experiences with students not showing up on time or having to reschedule. For example, TAs offered comments such as "If possible, avoid scheduling any time on Friday" so as to plan for students who miss their time slots, "try to make everyone schedule and show up on time", and "build in more than a 5 minute break every 30 minutes" or else, due to students not arriving to the meeting on time, "you'll need to use \[it\]".

### The TAs focused on Equity

Even before administering exams, TAs worried about their role not just as administrators but as graders. One worried that the grading might be "too subjective". Another worried about their "poor memory" and bias that could come from familiarity. One TA even cautioned against "food bias" where you many grade someone more harshly while hungry. Some of these issues were borne out during the first discussion when two TAs used different follow-up questions other than on the rubric when asking about an R object, and the teacher and one TA used different follow up questions to discuss R libraries. Several TAs after the first few oral exams expressed interest in changing the grading scale, so as to be fair to students who may have needed prompting, but still got the right answer.

The TAs were also worried that the oral exam would be confounded with speaking ability. In one exchange between the teacher and one TA, the TA shared one ESL student wanted to do it in person since, through zoom, "it \[was\] hard for them to understand the questions clearly". Other TAs during the first survey expressed similar views, with one on the final survey indicating that ESL students should be given more time, since "this is not an english test".

There were other minor focuses that didn't always consistently appear or only appeared because a they were explicitly asked in a survey: their views on oral vs written exams, and positive thoughts (if any) about the process.

### Their views on Oral vs Written Exams

After the first round of exams, a few TAs expressed doubt over the utility of the oral exam format. "Not sure what this accomplishes over HW/\[online\] quiz" on said. "A paper quiz", another said, "could serve the same goal". After seeing these responses, a specific question about their views on oral vs written exams was asked, with mixed responses. Half agreed there was something different or better, but those differences boiled down to "open book" vs "closed book" exams, examining "on the fly knowledge". Luckily one TA did mention the benefit of being able to "follow up". The other half thought that a well crafted, open ended quiz could essentially serve the same purpose.

### Positives or Oral exam experience

When asked directly about positives, only half of the TAs had something to say, with all the comments being centered around having increased student interactions where, in such a large class, they usually didn't. One TA commented that, unprovoked, a few students talked about liking the format.

## Discussion

**Matthew and Justin** will work on this part after literature review and results are complete.

Probably will mention this not being a good idea, probably losing what makes an Oral exam really good as we try to adapt to scale

Probably going to talk about how this is our attempt in a realistic setting....we could try to create an ideal one, and see, or we could couch it in based on the literature, ideally it would look like this. See that it's really not possible, this was our attempt realistically.

One big issue is most oral exams are in a problem based format, some questions, time....with only 5 minutes, you can't do that or do that well. You lose that part of really testing a student's thinking and assessing how well they can explain *and* do.

Issues with reliability.

**Future research questions** include

-   AI enhanced oral assessment?
-   Student perceptions positive in literature, but how does doing it for 5 minutes in zoom change things? Having to compare and contrast experiences
-   **Others?**

## Conclusion

**Matthew and Justin** will work on this part after literature review and results are complete.
