Recorded feedback in meeting in OralExamDiscussion1 (this was after the 308 oral exam but before the 307)

Feedback from Liz on 10/5/23
- Update wording about 'prompting' on the rubric as it may be misleading about what we would drop them down for
- She has a worry about not correcting the students right away in the meeting as that may continue misunderstandings
- A finer detail on the rubric would be nice so that we could give a 'half point' type idea

My feedback on 10/16
- It would be better to really have a trial run with some students. I got into a groove with what the prompts would be after about 10 students but it would be better if it was ready to go upfront for clarity and consistency
- I thought it was a great experience to be able to talk to them about it and see if they were lost or had an idea. 
- Watching Ryan's video to weigh in on a regrade, his delivery was really rough and I can see how the experience would be far less enjoyable for those students
- The process went really smoothly but of course there was one student that had trouble joining
